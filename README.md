This repository contains two Python scripts, `keyword_extract.py` and `OpenAI_chat_bot.py`, designed to leverage OpenAI's GPT models for various text-related tasks. Below is a brief overview of each script's functionality:


**AI-Assisted-Keyword-Extraction**

---
### `keyword_extract.py`

This script utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to extract keywords related to bio, healthcare, and food from a provided summary. It demonstrates how to integrate OpenAI's ChatCompletion API for natural language processing tasks. Key features include:

- Extraction of keywords from textual summaries using GPT-3.5
- Integration with Pandas for efficient data handling
- Creation of a CSV dataset storing extracted keywords

**AI-Assisted-Chat-Bot**

---
### `OpenAI_chat_bot.py`

In this script, OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model is employed to build a very simple chatbot interface. Users can engage in conversations with the chatbot, and responses are generated based on the input provided. Features include:

- Implementation of a conversational interface using GPT-3.5
- Integration with OpenAI's ChatCompletion API for generating responses
- User-friendly interface for interactive communication with the chatbot

---
**Usage**

To utilize these scripts effectively, follow the steps below:

1. **OpenAI API Key Setup**: Ensure you have an OpenAI API key and replace the placeholder with your actual key in both scripts.
   
2. **Data Input (for `keyword_extract.py`)**: Provide a CSV file containing summaries from which keywords are to be extracted. Ensure the summary column is labeled appropriately in the CSV file.

3. **Execution**: Run the respective Python scripts (`keyword_extract.py` for keyword extraction, `OpenAI_chat_bot.py` for chatbot interaction) in your preferred environment.

4. **Interaction (for `OpenAI_chat_bot.py`)**: Engage with the chatbot by inputting messages when prompted. To exit the chat, type "quit", "exit", or "bye".

5. **Output (for `keyword_extract.py`)**: Check the generated CSV file in the `dataset` directory for extracted keywords corresponding to each summary.

**Note**: Ensure dependencies such as Pandas and OpenAI's `openai` library are installed in your Python environment to execute these scripts successfully. For further details on installation and usage, refer to the documentation of these dependencies.
